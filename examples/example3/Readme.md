This example extracts information using py-makefile-dbparse then passes it directly onto scons <br>
For a simple set of C sources it wouldn't make much sense to do the build this way
but with more complex Makefile layouts this allows the mixing of Makefiles and scons so that everything doesn't have to be converted all at once
